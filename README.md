Hello everyone! This is my FIRST script that I have ever done and I wanted to share it with y'all if you wanted to use it in your own servers, etc.

This script is intended to be a "basic" trust system for your servers.

**How do I trust vehicles?**
- You will go to the cl_config.lua and you will have to manually input the name/hash of the vehicle.
**How do I get the hash?**
- With the script you are able to get the hash by spawning it in and getting it from console (one of the things you can uncomment out in the client.lua)


The following image shows the warning system when the person is kicked out of the vehicle.

I intend to release an updated version with an actual DB and using the server.lua to grab information and sort it for people to use. Aswell working with aceperms / groups.

If y'all have any suggestions or things that I should fix on the repo I would gladly appreciate the help/comments.
