Hello everyone! This is my FIRST script that I have ever done and I wanted to share it with y'all if you wanted to use it in your own servers, etc.

This script is intended to be a "basic" trust system for your servers.

**How do I trust vehicles?**
 - You will go to the cl_config.lua and you will have to manually input the name/hash of the vehicle.
**How do I get the hash?**
 - With the script you are able to get the hash by spawning it in and getting it from console (one of the things you can uncomment out in the client.lua)

I intend to release an updated version with an actual DB and using the server.lua to grab information and sort it for people to use. Aswell working with aceperms / groups.

If y'all have any suggestions or things that I should fix on the repo I would gladly appreciate the help/comments.
